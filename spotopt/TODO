Overall TODO:
-------------

Finish spotprog:
       - Basic functionality: layer around spotsdp.
       - Add "constraints" which optionally can have
       	 primal form and dual form representations.
       - Write SOSConstraint class.

Improve spotsdpsolver:
	- spotsdpsol shoudl store the solver as well.
	- Maybe add an "advice" functionality like sysid toolbox?
	- options interfaces
	- Need a interface for deciding can it be solved.
	- Add the ability to "preprocess"
